Description: Empirical models for runoff, erosion, and phosphorus loss 
    across a vegetated filter strip, given slope, soils, climate, and 
    vegetation (Gall et al., 2018) <doi:10.1007/s00477-017-1505-x>. 
    It also includes functions for deriving climate parameters from 
    measured daily weather data, and for simulating rainfall. Models 
    implemented include MUSLE (Williams, 1975) and APLE (Vadas et al., 
    2009 <doi:10.2134/jeq2008.0337>).
